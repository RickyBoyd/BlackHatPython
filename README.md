# Black Hat Python
Set of scripts I am writing in order to learn more about python, networking and networking security.
All scripts must be run as super user and all scripts require scapy to be installed (http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/installation.html.)

Ideas for expansion:
- Automatic banner grabbing
- LAN IP scanner
